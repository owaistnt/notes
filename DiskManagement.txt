Listing Block devices
lsblk
or
sudo fdisk -l


//check mounted partitions
mount | grep "sdb"


Unmount partitions
sudo umount /dev/sdb
or
sudo umount /media/owais/disk (this is the mount location)


Wiping the drive

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
//This will enter into prompt

Press P
// Will list all the partition of current device
Press M
// This will list all the supported commands

Press g
//To create new GPT partition table

Now
Pressing P
// Will not give any partition in the list

Press N
//To start process of creating partition


Lastly
Press W
//To write the changes to device..

Now we have a new partition table and partition but it doesnot have any File System. To create file system we have mkfs commend

e.g sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 //This will work
but sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb1 //will not work out of the box as exfat is windows proprietery stuff hence you will hve to install some packages

sudo apt install exfat-utils exfat-fuse
or for fedora
sudo dnf install fuse-exfat exfat-utils
//Now should work
sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb1
or
sudo mkfs.exfat -n "label" /dev/sdb1


//Space utilization of mounted devices
df -h

//Mounting in general
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disk1/

//Install disk monitor ncdu
which ncdu // to check if its already install

sudo apt install ncdu
or
sudo dnf install ncdu

For /etc/fstab see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7xH74o6kY0
//Simplest fstab entry look like
device  mountLocation   fs  options <dump> <pass>
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/disk1 ext4 defaults 0 0


# Getting the UUID
# Use command
sudo blkid
